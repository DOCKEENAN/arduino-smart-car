# arduino-smart-car

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/miquelbeltran/arduino-smart-car.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/miquelbeltran/arduino-smart-car)

Arduino project for the Elegoo UNO Project Smart Robot Car kit.

## Setup

1. Install PlatformIO.
2. Build with `make`
3. Upload to robot with `make upload`

## Working Environment

I don't use Arduino IDE, rather I just write code with Vim.

There's also a Makefile that handles all the PlatformIO commands.

I use the following tools to make my life easier:

- a.vim
- clang-format

The `.clang-format` is also included in the project.

## Legal Stuff

I have no relationship with Elegoo and I have no economical interest in promoting their hardware products. The code tutorials provided with the kit helped me write this project, however could be that some code examples have been copied from the code examples, but I am still the owner of this project and its code.

This project is distributed without warranty, so if your robot goes into flames or falls from the stairs, please don't blame me.

There's no license attached, but if you do something cooler, please share it.
